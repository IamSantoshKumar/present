# GTC Giveaway

[GPU Technology Conference](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gtc/) (GTC) is a series of technical conferences held by NVIDIA around the world. For 2020, I will be attending this conference virtually.  Earlier, I released a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhSi8MnwEFs) introducing GTC and gave away 3 free passes (Provided by NVIDIA) in return for subscribers listing three GTC presentations that they were interested in.  Whichever three presentations received the highest votes, I would cover in upcoming videos.

The top voted presentations were:

* The dawn of self-supervised learning in NLP and CV and its impact on Deep Fake generation and detection (five votes) [A21269] 
* GPU-Accelerated Data Pipelines for Scalable Recommender Systems (four votes) [A21350]
* Accelerating Insights from Geospatial Data Using GPUs and RAPIDS, and its Application to Public Sector Needs (two votes) [A21231]
